TODO:

***smd_gui DEV***

rationale: animation is now made up of two types of obj
StrutLine (gets coords from telem)
BodyLine (gets coords from top of struts in relevant StrutLines

theoretially, animation should run by 
get telem of latest frame
set StrutLines
get top of struts from StrutLine
set BodyLine

* class StrutLine
implement getter (to supply body_line with coords) 
and setter (for when animation updates strut positions)

* class BodyLine
implement init, getter(?), setter
